1. I love you, a little , a lot, passionately ... not at all
    Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

    1."I love you"
    2."a little"
    3."a lot"
    4."passionately"
    5."madly"
    6."not at all"
    If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.

    When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

    Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

2. Sum Arrays
    Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

    Examples
    Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
    Output: 9.2

    Input: []
    Output: 0

    Input: [-2.398]
    Output: -2.398

3. Beginner - Lost Without a Map
    Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

    For example:

    [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

4. Count the Monkeys!
    You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

    As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

    For example(Input --> Output):

    10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    1 --> [1]

5. Count of positives / sum of negatives
    Given an array of integers.

    Return an array, where the first element is the count of positives numbers and the second element is sum of negative numbers. 0 is neither positive nor negative.

    If the input is an empty array or is null, return an empty array.

    Example
    For input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15], you should return [10, -65].

6. Fundamentals: Return
    Make multiple functions that will return the sum, difference, modulus, product, quotient, and the exponent respectively.

    Please use the following function names:

    addition = add

    multiply = multiply

    division = divide (both integer and float divisions are accepted)

    modulus = mod

    exponential = exponent

    subtraction = subt

    Note: All math operations will be: a (operation) b

7. Sum without highest and lowest number
    Sum all the numbers of a given array ( cq. list ), except the highest and the lowest element ( by value, not by index! ).

    The highest or lowest element respectively is a single element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value.

    Mind the input validation.

    Example
    { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
    { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

8. Invert values
    Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

    invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
    invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
    invert([]) == []

9. Convert a String to a Number!
    We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

    Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

    Examples
    "1234" --> 1234
    "605"  --> 605
    "1405" --> 1405
    "-7" --> -7

10. My head is at the wrong end!
    You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has gone and switched their heads and tails around!

    Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values (tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round (head, body, tail).

    Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the element positions with the same exact logics

    Simples!

11. Array plus array
    I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

    P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.
