1. Cats and shelves
    An infinite number of shelves are arranged one above the other in a staggered fashion.
    The cat can jump either one or three shelves at a time: from shelf i to shelf i+1 or i+3 (the cat cannot climb on the shelf directly above its head), according to the illustration:

                    ┌────────┐
                    │-6------│
                    └────────┘
    ┌────────┐       
    │------5-│        
    └────────┘  ┌─────► OK!
                │    ┌────────┐
                │    │-4------│
                │    └────────┘
    ┌────────┐  │
    │------3-│  │     
    BANG!────┘  ├─────► OK! 
    ▲  |\_/|  │    ┌────────┐
    │ ("^-^)  │    │-2------│
    │ )   (   │    └────────┘
    ┌─┴─┴───┴┬──┘
    │------1-│
    └────────┘
    Input
    Start and finish shelf numbers (always positive integers, finish no smaller than start)

    Task
    Find the minimum number of jumps to go from start to finish

    Example
    Start 1, finish 5, then answer is 2 (1 => 4 => 5 or 1 => 2 => 5)

2. Send in the clones
    It seemed a good idea at the time...

    Why I did it?
    After a year on Codewars I really needed a holiday...

    But not wanting to drift backwards in the honour rankings while I was away, I hatched a cunning plan!

    The Cunning Plan
    So I borrowed my friend's "Clone Machine" and cloned myself :-)

    Now my clone can do my Kata solutions for me and I can relax!

    Brilliant!!

    Furthermore, at the end of the day my clone can re-clone herself...

    Double brilliant!!

    I wonder why I didn't think to do this earlier?

    So as I left for the airport I gave my clone instructions to:

    do my Kata solutions for me
    feed the cat
    try to keep the house tidy and not eat too much
    sleep
    clone yourself
    repeat same next day
    The Flaw
    Well, how was I supposed to know that cloned DNA is faulty?

    :-(

    Every time they sleep they wake up with decreased ability - they get slower... they get dumber... they are only able to solve 1 less Kata than they could the previous day.

    For example, if they can solve 10 Kata today, then tomorrow they can solve only 9 Kata, then 8, 7, 6... Eventually they can't do much more than sit around all day playing video games.

    And (unlike me), when the clone cannot solve any more Kata they are no longer clever enough to operate the clone machine either!

    The Return Home
    I suspected something was wrong when I noticed my Codewars honour had stopped rising.

    I made a hasty return home...

    ...and found 100s of clones scattered through the house. Mostly they sit harmlessly mumbling to themselves. The largest group have made a kind of nest in my loungeroom where they sit catatonic in front of the PlayStation.

    The whole place needs fumigating.

    The fridge and pantry are empty.

    And I can't find the cat.

    Kata Task
    Write a method to predict the final outcome where:

    Input:

    kata-per-day is the number of Kata I can solve per day
    Output:

    [number-of-clones, number-of-kata-solved-by-clones]

3. Factorial
    In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. By convention the value of 0! is 1.

    Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) or IllegalArgumentException (Java) or RangeException (PHP) or throw a RangeError (JavaScript) or ValueError (Python) or return -1 (C).

4. Fibonnaci
    Create function fib that returns n'th element of Fibonacci sequence (classic programming task).
