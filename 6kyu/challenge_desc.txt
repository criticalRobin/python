2. Array Product (Sans n)
    Given an array of numbers, your task is to return a new array where each index (new_array[i]) is equal to the product of the original array, except for the number at that index (array[i]).

    Two things to keep in mind:

    Zeroes will be making their way into some of the arrays you are given
    O(nÂ²) solutions will not pass.
    All input arrays will be valid arrays of nonzero length.

    Examples:
    [1, 2, 3, 4]              => [24, 12, 8, 6]
    [2, 3, 4, 5]              => [60, 40, 30, 24]
    [1, 1, 1]                 => [1, 1, 1]
    [9, 0, -2]                => [0, -18, 0]
    [0, -99, 0]               => [0, 0, 0]
